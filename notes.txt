-----parse incoming request body in express----
to parse incoming request in express js we install the third part
package npm install --save body-parser

body oaser will not parse complete data type but it will parse body from the from

we have to use it at the top of our middleware in all middleware section

----limiting middleware execution to post request----
app get allows us to filter from the get request
and same as app.post if changed to post or get then it fire was that request only
but if we use app.use then it can be used for post and get request


------using express router-----
to separate the routes logic we use the express js router function in the route js file
exact matching is done by get method not only method but path

-----add 404 page ----
request goes to top to bottom
app .use handle all type of request we cann add 404 by add ng middleware at the end using .use()

---filter path-----
all out source path have some common relative path  same path can be used for different methods
put a coomon segment at the start of our path

---creating html page-----
to send the html page in response we use the sendfile method but the path must be
exported from the module path with the join
join yeilds us a path in the end but it constructs a path by
concatenating different segments, first segment is __ understodd
by node js globally
direname holds an absolute path on our operating system to the project folder
../ means go up one level

----serve files statically---
directly forware to file system


----sharing data across request & users
data is inherent to node server and shared across the users in the browser

---template engines-----

htmlish template=> node express content / template engine (scans html and replace placeholders with html content)
=> dynamic htmk file generated and send to the users
Available engine:
EJS, PUG(Jade), HandleBars


---insalling and implemeneting pug-----
npm install --save ejs pug express-handlebars
pug is an expres feature not nodes
we set the global cnfiguration value in the server using express app
