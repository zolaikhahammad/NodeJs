-----parse incoming request body in express----
to parse incoming request in express js we install the third part
package npm install --save body-parser

body oaser will not parse complete data type but it will parse body from the from

we have to use it at the top of our middleware in all middleware section

----limiting middleware execution to post request----
app get allows us to filter from the get request
and same as app.post if changed to post or get then it fire was that request only
but if we use app.use then it can be used for post and get request


------using express router-----
to separate the routes logic we use the express js router function in the route js file
exact matching is done by get method not only method but path
